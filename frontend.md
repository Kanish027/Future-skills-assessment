## React Assignment

1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
   Ans:- Creating a Slice: Define state and slices in a Redux slice to manage shared functionality.
   Using useSelector and useDispatch: Access and dispatch actions from any component connected to the Redux store.

2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
   Ans:- The useState hook is appropriate for complex components because it allows you to manage state locally, preserve state across re-renders, and handle multiple state variables independently within the same component.

3. Design a user interface resembling the provided page. Fetch the data from the server and dynamically map the information cards to the fetched data. Ensure that the search functionality is also implemented.
